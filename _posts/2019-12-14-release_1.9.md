title: Release 1.9
---


Release 1.9 was published to Maven Central on December 14th, 2019.

Major points of this release are:

- improving throughput and cutting down on memory usage by implementing so-called "direct" I/O and better block request pipelining
- improving peer lookup and connectivity by figuring out which connections are duplicate and eliminating those
- allowing to create private DHTs within non-public networks (previously all nodes had to have public Internet address)

### Bug Fixes/Improvements:

* onTorrentStarted called twice [#117](https://github.com/atomashpolskiy/bt/issues/117)
* Add new onMetadataAvailable event (fired after torrent's metadata has been fetched)
* Allow cookie to be missing in the LSD announce message
* Make sure outgoing messages are never dropped
* Continuous piece assignments (better request pipelining)
* Direct I/O
* Add configuration option for the number of outstanding requests
* Add configuration option for send/receive buffer size
* Add CLI parameter for DHT port
* Allow bogon addresses, when using private DHT
* Reliably eliminate duplicate peer connections and self connections
